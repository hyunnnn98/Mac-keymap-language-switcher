Language-switcher is to solve the input delay for multi-language users in Mac OS using Hammerspoon.<br/>
ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· `Korean` ðŸ”„ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ `English` key-layout and ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ `Japanese` ðŸ”„ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ `English` key-layout are separated into different hot keys by `caps lock` and `right-cmd`.<br/>

## What is Hammerspoon?
This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.

What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user. With these, you can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.
